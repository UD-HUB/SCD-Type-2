# SCD Type 2 Implementation Using Pandas
This project demonstrates how to implement Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) Type 2 using the Pandas library in Python. SCD Type 2 involves tracking historical data by creating multiple records for a given natural key in the dimensional tables with separate surrogate keys and version numbers.

## SQL Integration
In this project, all SQL operations such as creating tables, adding new items, and managing the dataset are also implemented using Python. This ensures that the project is self-contained and provides a comprehensive understanding of SCD Type 2.
